# The Gingerlens
Making the first AR headset with spatial awareness that won't break the bank. 

# Coding Details
Coded in Python along wiht Godot's custom language. Used PyCharm for my Python IDE and Godot as the game engine. Used the Realsense D415 as my depth sensor and the BNO055 as my IMU. 

# Hardware Details
Meant to be built for the Orange Pi 5, an ARM Linux device, along with the realsense d415 as the depth sensor. 

# What's Already Done 
- Simplified and fast realtime depth tracking
- BNO055 data transfer to Godot
- Configured Godot to run Python laterally with the engine
