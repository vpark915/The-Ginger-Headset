# The Gingerlens
Making the first AR headset with spatial awareness that won't break the bank. 
Using the intel realsense d415 for spatial and rgb detection 
BNO055 for detecting orientation 
Application is written in Godot (Unity python support sucks)
Soon to come: 
- Android hand tracking service
- Maybe custom OS
